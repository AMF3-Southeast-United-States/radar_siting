# AMF3 radar siting and clutter analysis tool
Simple Jupyter-Lab radar siting notebooks that can be run in Binder and use the wradlib tool to conduct a clutter analysis. The base version uses only DEM information while the Google Earth Engine version uses DEM and tree height information to evaluate potential ground clutter. 

This repo is a work in progress
